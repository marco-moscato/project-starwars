# Project Starwars Planets Search
Starwars Planets Search is a web application that shows a list of planets from Star Wars universe, which comes from an API. It also uses quite a few High Order Functions to filter and display planets on screen according to user selection.
It was part of my Web Development course at Trybe and the goal was to practice React with function components, using Context API and React Hooks to manage global state and life cycle. Tests were also developed to cover most part of application, using Jest and React Testing Library.
